# API Documentation Portfolio Project
This is a mock API documentation site for a fictitious photo hosting service called Starwipe. It was created as a final group portfolio project for the [Professional Technical Writing (PTW)](https://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/professional-technical-writing) program at the University of Washington. We named our group Starwipe Productions.

This is the original, now archived version of the project as it was submitted by my group at the end of the PTW program (Nov 2023). I have a personal working copy of the site at [bierut.stoplight.io](https://bierut.stoplight.io/) that reflects any subsequent edits and updates I've made to the project since then.

## Project Overview
Starwipe Productions has created a simulation of a proprietary photo hosting API for use with third-party platforms. Weâ€™ve generated an array of requests, parameters, and responses based on industry leading examples. We have also included user models built from research related to real world API users.

Our aim is to provide a clear easy to translate experience for developers to add a new set of tools to their belt.

## User Research
### [API User Persona](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oLb-2fA2OoBLduLjSTnktbi3vS9e8E9X/view?usp=sharing)
This example user was created based on interviews with developers who have experience implementing APIs in their respective work.

### [Empathy Map](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J3FLPJJslvAWZ65e3CiihffMTASCgA55/view?usp=sharing)
Our empathy map breaks down what our ideal users would be looking for in successful API documentation.

### [User Journey Map](https://drive.google.com/file/d/103QHkSiA6312WRDB6lpb56A50Jkm6H3_/view?usp=sharing)
The Journey map is a guide to how we envision users to interact with our documentation from first interaction to completion.
